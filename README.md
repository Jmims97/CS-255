Module 8

1. Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
   -
   - DriverPass was a project aimed at designing a system to help users prepare for driving tests by offering practice exams and tutorials. The client for this project wanted a comprehensive online platform that could simulate driving test conditions and offer personalized feedback to help users improve their driving skills.

2. What did you do particularly well?
   -
   - One of the key strengths in this project was the thorough understanding and integration of user requirements into the system design. The use of clear and detailed UML diagrams to map out the system’s functionalities and interactions was also done effectively.
  
3. If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
   -
   - The Uml sequence documentation could use more details.
  
4. How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
   -
   - User needs were interpreted by reading interview transcripts and by closely analyzing the problem statement provided by the client. Considering user needs is crucial in system design because it ensures that the product is relevant and effective.
  
5. How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
   -
   - I approach software developement with UML Diagrams. Creating use case diagrams, sequence diagrams, and class diagrams helped to visualize system interactions and architecture which I will be using in the future along with reviewing requirement documents.
